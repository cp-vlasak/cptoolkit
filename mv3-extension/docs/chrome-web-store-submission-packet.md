## Single Purpose

CivicPlus employee-only toolkit that adds approved workflow helpers to CivicPlus CMS, Design Center, Live Edit, identity, and trusted customer vanity-domain admin/editor pages.

## Remote Code Declaration

Select: no remote code execution.

Notes:

- Extension scripts are bundled local files.
- The MV3 activation pipeline selects fixed local files from `js/background/toolkit-injection-registry.js`.
- On-demand tools are injected by the service worker using fixed files from `data/on-demand-tools.json`.
- Some tools can copy or write customer-site HTML/CSS snippets that contain external URLs, but those are site content outputs, not extension-loaded remote code.

## Permission Justifications

- `storage`: stores toolkit settings, saved snippets, saved skins/buttons, trusted vanity origins, and user workflow preferences locally in Chrome.
- `contextMenus`: provides employee-invoked on-demand tools from the browser context menu.
- `scripting`: injects bundled toolkit scripts only after CivicPlus CMS/Live Edit/identity detection or a user action.
- `alarms`: runs the session-timeout check reliably in background tabs without relying on throttled page timers.
- `webNavigation`: locates specific CMS iframe targets for image picker and upload workflows that require frame-aware behavior.
- `activeTab`: lets the popup inspect the current tab after a user gesture, especially before requesting an exact-origin vanity-domain permission.
- Required host permissions: limited to enumerated CivicPlus-owned platform and QA hosts so the detector/bootstrap can run on known CivicPlus surfaces.
- Optional host permissions: `https://*/*` is used only to request the current exact customer vanity origin after user action and positive DOM-marker detection.

## Web Accessible Resources Justification

Web-accessible resources are limited to assets that activated tools must load into CMS pages.

- CP platform hosts can access bundled JSON, images, helper scripts, social assets, custom CSS, and Font Awesome assets needed by activated tools.
- Trusted vanity domains can access selected JSON/images/helper scripts through a dynamic HTTPS entry after origin trust.
- Font Awesome CSS/fonts are listed in a separate static HTTPS entry because the stylesheet loads fonts by relative URL on activated vanity pages.
- On-demand tool scripts are not web-accessible; they are injected by the service worker.

## Privacy Practices Draft

Recommended disclosure: no sale or transfer of user data. Data is stored locally in Chrome extension storage for employee workflow preferences and reusable snippets/skins/buttons. The extension does not send browsing data or saved toolkit data to CivicPlus or third-party analytics.

Public policy page: `https://cp-vlasak.github.io/cptoolkit/privacy.html`

If the dashboard asks for data categories, review carefully with the final privacy owner. The working assumption is local extension storage only, not external collection.

## Upload Checklist

1. Confirm local QA by loading the source-of-truth `mv3-extension` folder unpacked.
2. Run release checks and guardrails.
3. Create `mv3-extension/dist/civicplus-internal-toolkit-1.1.6.zip` directly from the tested source tree, including only `manifest.json`, `css/`, `data/`, `html/`, `images/`, `js/`, and `socials/`.
4. Verify `manifest.json` is at the ZIP root, the packaged version is `1.1.6`, and every packaged file matches the source tree.
5. Upload the ZIP in Chrome Developer Dashboard.
6. Review Package, Store Listing, Privacy Practices, and Distribution tabs.
7. Submit for review.

The artifact above was assembled and byte-compared against the source tree on 2026-07-26. If any runtime source file changes during acceptance testing, rebuild the ZIP and replace the size, file count, and SHA-256 recorded here.

Release owner reported local unpacked acceptance testing passed on 2026-07-27 and approved the candidate for merge and upload. Rollback checkpoint `pre-v1.1.6-2026-07-27` preserves the exact pre-merge v1.1.5 `main` state.

## Manual QA Still Worth Doing Before Clicking Submit

- Known CP admin host activates toolkit normally.
- Known CP public Live Edit activates toolkit only when editor chrome is present.
- Trusted vanity Admin/DesignCenter and public Live Edit activate after the trust flow.
- Unknown non-CP page stays inactive and does not show extension errors.
- Theme Manager, Widget Manager, Graphic Links, snippet library, and Fancy Button library load without console regressions.
- Context-menu on-demand tools still appear and run on matching pages.
- Prevent-timeout has no extension errors after a two-minute alarm cycle with several CP tabs open.
